# Calculator-or-is-it-
The app looks exactly like a calculator, but when a secret code is entered, it reveals hidden notes. It acts like a Secret Vault. Enter the secret code 69/67 and press = to enter the hidden notes editor window.


This project is a disguised calculator application that secretly functions as a notes vault, where entering a specific calculation opens a private notes interface. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, input correction, error handling, and maintains a history using localStorage. The hidden vault allows users to create, edit, and delete multiple notes, with each note automatically saved and persisted across sessions. Notes display only a title preview derived from the first line (or “Untitled” if empty), while full content remains hidden until opened. The built-in editor supports rich text formatting such as bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, undo/redo, and image insertion at the cursor position. Images are embedded directly into individual notes, persist correctly, and do not carry over between notes. The entire application runs client-side without any backend and is deployed using GitHub Pages for public access.
